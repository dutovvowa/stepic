# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a minimal Git repository (`stepic-main`) that appears to be a learning/practice repository. Currently contains only a README.md file with basic information in Russian.

## Common Commands

### Git Operations
```bash
# Check repository status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push changes to remote (when remote is configured)
git push origin main
```

### Development Setup
Since this is a minimal repository, the development setup will depend on what type of project is added:

```bash
# For Python projects
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Node.js projects
npm install
npm start

# For general file operations
ls -la                    # List all files including hidden
find . -name "*.ext"     # Find files by extension
```

## Repository Structure

Currently minimal:
- `README.md` - Basic repository description in Russian
- `.git/` - Git version control directory

## Development Notes

- This appears to be a learning repository ("Мой первый репозиторий" = "My first repository")
- No specific technology stack has been established yet
- Repository is ready for initial development work
- Consider adding a .gitignore file appropriate for your chosen technology stack
- Consider adding license and contributing guidelines as the project grows

## Future Considerations

As this repository develops, consider updating this WARP.md with:
- Specific build commands for your chosen technology
- Testing commands and frameworks used
- Deployment procedures
- Code architecture details
- Development workflow and contribution guidelines
